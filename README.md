# R3dd1t
reddit bot for discord, written in python using the reddit api, and hosted on heroku.

besides the cringe l33t naming scheme, r3dd1t is a simplistic, reliable bot made to fetch random posts of the subreddit specified. i made it because i wanted to be able to look at reddit without having to sift through older and newer posts. this allows me to do so. it was also designed to be very easy to use.

## Usage
you can add the bot via it's [invite link](https://discordapp.com/channels/422293824770146304/422311739028275210/695417594420658177), or you can self host it yourself.
i personally host it on heroku, but as an alternative in which you can host the bot free of cost, though i would just add the bot.
it has 24/7 uptime as heroku is a reliable host. (please credit me by my discord, or by my github, if you intend to self host.)

*r~help* is the help command, which is also shown in it's status. *r/* is the prefix for finding subreddits, while *u/* is the prefix for finding a user's *public* information. r3ddit makes no attempts to access anything that couldn't already

## Stability
r3dd1t is always live, reliable and quick. hours of work and bug testing have been undergone to ensure that it stays this was and is as user friendly as possible. all the bugs have already been fixed, and the only bugs that can occur are from future updates.
i will try to fix all bugs as soon as possible

## Features
features for r3dd1t will be based on feedback of the bot, using the feedback command or ideas i decide will improve the bot.
