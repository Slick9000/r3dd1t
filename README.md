**r/** is the prefix for finding subreddits, 

**u/** is the prefix for finding a user's *public* information. r3ddit makes no attempts to access anything that couldn't already be accessed publically.

**r-help** is the help command, which is also shown in it's status. 

**r-feedback** allows you to send user feedback directly to me, the bot owner!

r3dd1t is always live, reliable and quick. hours of work and bug testing have been undergone to ensure that it stays this way.

there are currently no future planned updates for this bot, so feel free to send me feedback if there is anything you desire.
