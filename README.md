# R3dd1t
reddit bot for discord, written in python using the reddit api, and hosted on heroku.

besides the cringe l33t naming scheme, r3dd1t is a simplistic, reliable bot made to fetch random posts of the subreddit specified. i made it because i wanted to be able to look at reddit without having to sift through older and newer posts. this allows me to do so.

## Usage
you can add the bot via it's [invite link](https://discordapp.com/channels/422293824770146304/422311739028275210/695417594420658177), or you can self host it yourself.
i personally host it on heroku, which is an alternative in which you can host the bot free of cost, though i would just add the bot.
it has 24/7 uptime as heroku is a reliable host.

*r~help* is the help command, which is also shown in it's status. *r/* is the prefix for finding subreddits, while *u/* is the prefix for finding a user's *public* information.

## Stability
r3dd1t works 99% of the time. There is currently a slight issue within the code, where the bot does not find the entire subreddit in a search.
this is actually a bug i know how to fix via reddit's api reference.
it should be fixed soon. it only happens for a few subreddits.
a feature will also be added to only fetch the absolute newest posts from that subreddit in the near future.
